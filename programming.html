        I have ideas for several programming projects that I just need the motivation for.
        This website is a project in itself that I will continue adding to in addition
        to anything featured on this page. Links to readily available to try javascript
        experiments are below as well as information on other projects I am working on.

        <h3>Junkbot</h3>
        <p>
          Right now a proof of concept, will be a game where your mouse controls a flying drone
          with which a robot on the ground must use to aim (Broken enemy sensors or something).
          The robot can move left and right with the arrow keys and shoot by clicking.
          Take out the enemies (when there are some) without hitting the drone.
